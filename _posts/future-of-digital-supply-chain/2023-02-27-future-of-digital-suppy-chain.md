Supply chain is rapidly changing, thanks to new digital tools and processes such as RPA, ML and IoT. COVID-19 sped up the digitalization process but the evolution has been happening for some time. Companies must concentrate on developing new competencies, roles, and duties as well as new organizational structures in order to successfully change and meet the needs of the evolving marketplace.

It’s important to note that digital transformation will likely to fail without a skilled workforce that can effectively use and scale the advanced systems and tools. Big portion of the companies are still facing the risk of “pilot purgatory” because they lack the talent to implement, scale and maintain these initiatives. According to McKinsey report, approximately 45% of the global supply chain workforce lacks the skills needed to meet new expectations. To address this, companies need to invest in new skills such as an end-to-end supply chain mindset, cross-functional communication skills, data mastery, and analytical abilities. Investing in these skills can provide a competitive advantage and achieve superior performance across the key dimensions of service, cost, and capital.
